# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of the Prework Study Guide is to keep notes collected and organized in a manner that is easy to view. By keeping all of the information together on one page, it solves the problem of having multiple notes in random text files and sticky notes that will be forgotten and inevitably find themselves going into the recylcing bin at some point in the not too distant future. This has the added benefit of speeding up the research process when trying to find that little piece of code that you keep forgetting the exact syntax to (I'm looking at you flexbox and grid).

Problem solved.
